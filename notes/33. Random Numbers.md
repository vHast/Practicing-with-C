### 33 - Random Numbers

Pseudo random numbers is a set of values or elements that are statistically random.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

int main() {

 	srand(time(0));

   	int number1 = (rand() % 6 + 1);
    int number2 = (rand() % 6 + 1);
    int number3 = (rand() % 6 + 1);

    printf("%d", number1);
    printf("%d", number2);
    printf("%d", number3);
    return 0;
}
```

```c
srand(time(0));
```

Srand stands for ( s for seed, rand for random), it is used to seed the random number generator,initalizes the random number generator with a seed value, in this case **the result of time(0)**

By providing time(0) as the seed, you're ensuring that the number generator is initialized with a different seed every time the program is run

After seeding the random number generator **srand(time(0))** the code generates three random numbers between 1 and 6 using the expressions rand() % 6 + 1

```c
int number = rand() % 6 + 1;
```

This line of code generates a random number and assigns it to the variable 'number'.

**rand()** will generate a pseudorandom integer that returns a random integer between 0 and the constant 'RAND_MAX', which is a large integer value defined in the C standard library.

**% 6** is the modulus operator, which calculates the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand, used to limit the range of the random number generated by **rand()**.
