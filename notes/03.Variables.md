### 03 - Variables

Variables are allocated spaces in memory to store a value, we refer to a variable's name to access the stored value, that variable now behaves as it was the value it contains but we need to declare what type of data we are storing.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

	int x; 				// Declaration
 	x = 123;			// Initialization
  	int y = 321; 		// Declaration + Initialization
   	int age = 21; 		// Integer (whole number)
    float gpa = 2.05; 	// Floating point number ( decimal portion)
    char grade = 'C'; 	// Single characters
    char name[] = "Bro" // Array of characters

    printf("Hello %s,\n", name); // Formating with array of characters (strings)
    printf("You are %d years old\n", age); // Formatting with digits
    printf("Your average grade is %c\n", grade); // Formatting with char
    printf("Your GPA is %.1f\n", gpa); // Formatting with float
   
}
```
