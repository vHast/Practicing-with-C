### 04 - Data Types

- Working with booleans

First we're going to need to import <stdbool.h>

```c
#include <stdbool.h>

bool e = true;	// 1 byte %d

```

- Char characters

We can store a whole integer between the range (-128 to +127)

```c
char f = 100;
```

We can display this number as a **decimal** or a **character**, if we'd like to display it as a character, we would have to use an [ASCII table](https://www.asciitable.com/) to associate this number into a character representation.

The ASCII table has a range of 0 to 127.

```c
printf("%c\n", f); // This will display "d"
```

- Unsigned char

When it is **unsigned**, we disregard any negative numbers, so this doubles our range with our positive numbers up to 255.

We'll have to use that in case we don't want to use any negative numbers in the code, if it goes outside the range, it will reset the number into an int value of 0.

```c
unsigned char g = 256; // This will overflow and revert back to 0;
```

- Short int

```c
short int h = 32767;			// 2 bytes (-32,768 to +32,767) %d
unsigned short int i = 65535;	// 2 bytes (0 to +65,535) %d
```
