### 39 - Writing files in C

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	FILE *pF = fopen("test.txt", "w");
 
	fprintf(pF, "Washington Post");
 	fclose(pF); // Good practice to clsoe the file after running the necessary operations
  	return 0;
}
```

This will create a new file called test.txt and it will write it.

We have set the pointer as an argument without dereferencing and set what we want to write

In case that we would like to append something at the end of our document

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	FILE *pF = fopen("test.txt", "a"); // a for appending
 
	fprintf(pF, "\nThe New York Times");
 	fclose(pF);
  	return 0;
}
```

In case that you would like to remove the file

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	if(remove("test.txt") == 0) {
 		printf("That file was deleted successfully!)
    } else {
    	printf("That file was not deleted)
    }
}
```

In case that you would like to set the file in a specific path

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	FILE *pF = fopen("/home/kaz/Active/BroCode/Practicing-with-C/C-Files/test.txt", "w"); // Setting a definitive directory for test file placement
 
	fprintf(pF, "\nThe New York Times");
 	fclose(pF);
  	return 0;
}
```
