### 40 - Reading files in C

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	FILE *pF = fopen("/home/kaz/Active/BroCode/Practicing-with-C/C-Files/poem.txt", "r"); // r fopr reading

 	char buffer[255]; // Holds one line at a time
  	fgets(buffer, 255, pF); // This will read the first line at the top
   	printf("%s", buffer);
	fclose(pF);
 	return 0;
}
```
This will effectively read the first line of our program, however, if we would like to read everything, we would have to scan all the lines with a loop.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

	FILE *pF = fopen("/home/kaz/Active/BroCode/Practicing-with-C/C-Files/poem.txt", "r"); // r fopr reading

 	char buffer[255]; // Holds one line at a time

  	while(fgets(buffer, 255, pF) != NULL) {
   		printf("%s", buffer);
    }
	fclose(pF);
 	return 0;
}
```

Adding some file detection

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

	FILE *pF = fopen("/home/kaz/Active/BroCode/Practicing-with-C/C-Files/poem.txt", "r"); // r fopr reading

 	if(pF == NULL) {
  		printf("Unable to open file");
    } else {
    	char buffer[255]; // Holds one line at a time
		while(fgets(buffer, 255, pF) != NULL) {
   		printf("%s", buffer);
    	}
    }
    
	fclose(pF);
 	return 0;
}
```
