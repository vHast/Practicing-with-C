### Pre-practice

```c
#include <stdio.h>
```

Pre-processor that tells the compiler to include the contents of a file nad the file that we want

```c
int main() {

}
```

Entry point of the program, main()

```c
return 0;
```
The program returns 0 if it runs successfully with no errors, if there is, the program will return one.

```c
[Done] exited with code=0 in 0.048 seconds
```
