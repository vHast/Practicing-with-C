### 09 - User input

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	char name[25];

 	int age;

  	printf("\nWhat's your name?");
   	scanf("%s", &name);

    printf("How old are you?");
    scanf("%d", &age);

    printf("\nHello %s, how are you?", name);
    printf("\nYou are %d years old", age);

    return 0;
}
```

**scanf** will scan the input and then set it into the value determined on the right.

The & symbol is typically used to retrieve the memory address of a variable.

However this code has a bug, in the case that we attempted to type a name and a surname, it will only print the first value since **scanf() will only read until any whitespaces appear**

In this case we'll have to make use of the **fgets()** function.

```c
int main() {

 	fgets(name, 25, stdin);
}
```

We'll have to list the **name of the variable**, then we need to set the **input size**, which will be matched with the size of the **name[]** array, and then **stdin** which means standard input.

The only bad thing about this is that it will print the newline as well when we set the value in the fgets function

```c
Hello Federico Alvarez
, how old are you? // There should be no newline element here
```

If you need to get rid of that, you'll have to include **<string.h>** in the C file.

Using this import will help us deal with strings and we'll help us to get that string and remove the newline character in the end

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h> // <--

int main() {
	char name[25];
	int age;

 	printf("\nWhat's your name?");
  	fgets(name, 25, stdln);
   	name[strlen(name)-1] = '\0';
}

```

name[strlen(name)-1] = '\0'; will replace the "\n" element into a "\0" element, which stands for **null**.
