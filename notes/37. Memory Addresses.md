### 37 - Memory Addresses

**Memory** - Array of bytes within RAM (street)
**Memory block** - A single unit (byte) within memory, used to hold some value (person)
**Memory address** - The address of where a memory block is located (house address)

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	char a = 'X';
 	char b = 'Y';
  	char c = 'Z';

   	printf("%d bytes\n", sizeof(a));
	printf("%d bytes\n", sizeof(b));
	printf("%d bytes\n", sizeof(c));
   	
}
```

The size of each of these characters is 1 byte = 8 bits, each of these variables is using a single block of memory (byte), which we can also print

```c
	printf("%p\n", &a); // 0x7fffeb22e43f
 	printf("%p\n", &b);	// 0x7fffeb22e43e
  	printf("%p\n", &c);	// 0x7fffeb22e43d
```

These are the (street) addresses of each of our memory blocks (1 byte)

However if we started to use shortsâ€¦ (2 bytes size)

```c
	printf("%p\n", &a); // 0x7fff3bbc6ffe
 	printf("%p\n", &b);	// 0x7fff3bbc6ffc
  	printf("%p\n", &c);	// 0x7fff3bbc6ffa
```
