### 07 - Arithmetic Operators

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

	// Arithmetic operators
 
 	// + (addition)
  	// - (substraction)
   	// * (multiplication)
    // / (division)
    // % (modulus)
    // ++ (increment)
    // -- (decrement)

    int x = 5;
    int y = 2;

	float z = x / y;

    printf("%d", z);
    
}
```

Some precautions have to be taken with these operations, for example

```c
int x = 5;
int y = 2; 
int z = x / y;
```

Will truncate the values and we would lose precision, in this case, it can be fixed by **setting z as a float value** or pre-seeding these values deep into the operation

```c
int x = 5;
int y = 2
 
float z = x / (float) y;
```

Modulus gives you the remainder of a division
