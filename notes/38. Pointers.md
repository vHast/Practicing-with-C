### 38 - Pointers

A variable-like refertence that holds a memory address to another variable, array, etc.

Some tasks are performed more easily with pointers.

```c
* // Indirection operator (value at address)
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	int age = 21;

 	printf("Address of age: %p\n", &age); 	// 0x7ffc0263135c
  	printf("Value of age: %d\n", age);		// 21
}
```

To create a pointerâ€¦

```c
	int *pAge = &age;
```

Dereferencing a pointer

```c
	printf("Value at stored address: %d\n", *pAge);
```

This needs some work to be done
