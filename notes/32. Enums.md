### 32 - Enums

Short for enumeration.

A user defined type of named integer identifiers, helps to make a program more readable.

Enums are constants.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

enum Day{Sun = 1, Mon = 2, Tue = 3, Wed = 4, Thu = 5, Fri = 6, Sat = 7};
	// Each of these constants has an associated integer

 	// Sun = 0, Mon = 1 ...

  	int main() {

		enum Day today = Sun;

  		printf("%d\n", today); // 1

    	if(today == Sun || today == Sat) {
     		printf("\nIt's the weekend.");
        } else {
        	printf("\nI have to work today");
        }

    return 0;
    }

  
```

Enums are not strings but they can be treated as int
