### 27 - Swap values between variables

This practice is common between sorting algorithms

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
	char x = 'X';
 	char y = 'Y';
    char temp;

    temp =x;

    x = y;
    y = temp;

    printf("x = %c\n", x); // X
   	printf("y = %c\n", y); // Y

  	return 0;
}
```

It is usual practice to store the variable that we want to copy into a temporary variable and then switch it.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
	char x[15] = "Water";
 	char y[15] = "Lemonade";
    char temp[15];

    strcpy(temp, x);
    strcpy(x, y);
    strcpy(y, temp);

    printf("x = %c\n", x); // X
   	printf("y = %c\n", y); // Y

  	return 0;
}
```

When using strcpy(), if the **length of the element that we want to copy is less than the variable that we want to copy to** , it might result in unexpected behavior.

For fixing this we could just set the length of each of those arrays as the same.
